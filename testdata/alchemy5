Harry Potter was released in the United
Kingdom under the title Harry Potter
and the Philosopher’s Stone. The title
was changed to Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer’s Stone for the US market. The
main reason is because—and rightly so—
the publisher figured that most Americans
wouldn’t get “philosopher’s stone.” But
the original title was actually far more
appropriate. Here’s why.
Throughout history, kings, queens, and, well, anyone who
was anyone, deeply desired the philosopher’s stone. Why?
Because legend said that with the philosopher’s stone, you
could make two things that pretty much everyone wants:
endless money and to live forever.
Alchemy was the attempt to turn ordinary substances into
gold or a potion for an everlasting life. Alchemy is the ancestor
of modern-day chemistry. It was a mix of chemistry and
sorcery, so it wasn’t a true science by today’s standards.
But sorcery, ghosts, and demons were as real to people 200
years ago as DNA is to us today. And unlike modern science,
alchemy was shrouded in secrets and mystery.
People who practiced alchemy were called alchemists. All
alchemists sought the philosopher’s stone. This legendary
stone was not really a rock. Or maybe it was a rock that you
ground up into a powder. In any case, it was a substance that
could be used to do two things. The first was change ordinary
metals into gold. Whoever had the philosopher’s stone could
have unimaginable riches. The second was to make a drink
called the elixir of life. An elixir is kind of like
a medicine. Drinking it would make you live
longer, or even forever.
Alchemists based their science on the idea
that the world is made up of four basic
elements. These are earth, air, fire, and water.
Modern science tells us that the world is
made up of elements, too (and atoms).
Alchemists worked in labs that were very similar Harry Potter’s
Potions classes. The alchemists mixed different—and often
weird—things together and recited spells. They hoped these
brews would magically form into the philosopher’s stone. None
ever did, as you can imagine.
What’s interesting is that through modern chemistry, you
can actually combine certain elements to create gold.
Unfortunately, it costs much more to make gold than to buy it.
So it’s not worth the effort.
Modern chemistry can’t make you live forever, but it can help
people live longer lives. As science advances, it could help
people live to be 120 or even 150 years old. They believe that
such a long life will be possible through a mix of healthy living
and gene therapy. They also believe that these scientific
advances could happen within your lifetime. But don’t tell You-
Know-Who.
