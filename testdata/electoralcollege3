Many people were surprised when Donald Trump was elected President in 2016. 
Why? Because more
people voted for Hillary Clinton. Two million more,
in fact.
So how did she lose if more people voted for her?
Because we do not vote directly for the president.
We vote for Electoral votes. A candidate needs the
most Electoral votes to win the election.
Have you heard of the Electoral College? It’s not a
school. It is the way we elect the President. It was set
up by the Founding Fathers. They made the first laws
for our country.
Each state has two U.S. Senators.
Each Senator gets one Electoral
vote. So every state starts with
two votes. States get one
Electoral vote for each of its
U.S. Representatives. States
with more people have more
Representatives. States with less
people have less.
Let’s look at Maryland. Maryland has two Senators.
It has eight Representatives. So it has 10 Electoral
votes. On election day, voters go to the poles.
They vote for their favorite candidate. At the end
of the day, Maryland counts all these votes. The
candidate with the most votes wins Maryland’s 10
Electoral votes.
After an election, all the states count their votes.
They tell which candidate won in which states. Then
they add up all the Electoral Votes. The candidate
with the most Electoral votes wins.
