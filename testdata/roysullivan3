There’s a saying that “lightning never strikes twice.” Well,
tell that to Roy Sullivan. Roy was struck by lightning seven
different times and lived to tell about it. He became known as
the human lightning rod.
Roy Sullivan was born in 1912 and became a United States
park ranger in 1936 for the Shenandoah National Park in
Virginia. Since part of his job was to patrol the enormous
park, Roy often worked outside. Being on patrol meant that
he could not always find a safe place to take shelter during
thunderstorms.
Roy was struck by lightning for the first time in 1942 while out
on patrol. He tried to escape the storm by hiding under a
newly built lookout tower. But being new, no one had installed
the lightning rod yet.
Lightning rods are long metal rods attached
to the outside of buildings. They protect
buildings from lightning by grounding the
electricity. A lightning rod runs from the top
of the roof down the side of the building
and into the ground. When lightning strikes
the rod, the electricity travels down the rod into the ground,
saving the building from major damages.
In 1942, the tower under which Roy hid was struck by lightning
seven or eight times and caught fire. Roy ran out into the rain
to escape the flames and was struck by a bolt of lightning
that burned a strip along his leg, hit his toe, and left a hole in
his shoe.
Over the years, Roy suffered many lightning-related injuries,
which were mostly burns to his body. His hair caught on fire
and his eyebrows and eyelashes were burnt off.
Roy holds the world record for most lightning strikes. Over
time, Roy became sure that lightning followed him.
Lightning hit Roy for the last time in 1977 while he was fishing
in a small pond. The lightning hit the top of his head, setting
his hair on fire and burning his chest and stomach. Dazed,
Roy painfully turned around in the direction of his car and
came face to face with a bear—which was after Roy’s
catch. He hit the bear with a stick and ran to his car. He said
it was the twenty-second time in his life that he had to hit a
bear with a stick.
Roy died in 1983 at age 71. He is still the most famous ranger
in Shenandoah National Park.
