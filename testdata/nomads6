Dahlia couldn’t believe that she was missing Sarah’s birthday party
for this. Sarah’s parents had rented the entire Splash Harbor
Amusement Park and invited everyone in grade 12. It was going to
be the party of the year, and Dahlia desperately wanted to go .
Instead, she was stranded for the summer in Kyrgyzstan with only her
babushka, Aidana, for company.
Dahlia stared forlornly out of
the window of Aidana’s car,
watching the Kyrgyzstan
countryside roll by. Had she
not been so annoyed, Dahlia
might have appreciated the
sprawling mountains and clear
blue rivers they passed, but
she ignored the scenery
completely.
Pulling out her phone, Dahlia opened the YouTube app. When the
home page failed to load, her eyes flicked to the bars at the top of
her screen. Zero reception. Dahlia groaned, and irritation flared in
the pit of her stomach. Derek Yeon’s latest video was out, but she
couldn’t watch it.
Derek Yeon was Dahlia’s favorite You Tuber. The
23-year-old aspiring journalist travelle d the
world documenting the lives of everyday
people in a series called Interesting Places.
Yeon was very cool, had a wicked sense of
humor and visited weird and beautiful places,
but Dahlia wouldn’t be able to see his latest
video because she was stuck in Kyrgyzstan.
“Stop pouting,” Aidana scolded.
Dahlia turned her gaze to her babushka. The
stern woman was nothing like Dahlia’s Texan
grandma, Rose, who always wore cowboy boots
and a Stetson, was quick with a joke, and smiled easily. “I’m not
pouting,” Dahlia said, sticking out her bottom lip.
“Yes, you are. You’ve been pouting since you stepped off that plane
in Bishkek three days ago,” Aidana sighed. “I know that you don’t
want to be here, but it is important that you know about where you
come from and learn about our culture.”
“I know where I come from,” Dahlia protested. “And we have plenty
of culture back home.”
Aidana eyed Dahlia skeptically. “What do you know about
Kyrgyzstan?”
“I know that it used to be part of the Soviet Union,” Dahlia
answered. “I know that it’s a country in Asia bordered by
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. I know that for some
crazy reason, Dad wanted me to spend the summer here in the
middle of nowhere when I could have been at Sarah’s birthday
party!” She glanced back down at her phone. Still no service.
Aidana sighed again. “We’re not in the middle of nowhere, Dahlia.
Look out the window.”
Dahlia looked up from her disconnected phone and focused her
attention out the window. The countryside stretched out as far as
Dahlia could see. Mountains rose up on either side of the car. The
road followed a bright blue river which cut through the heart of the
heavily forested valley. Trees, trees and more trees , thought Dahlia.
A short time later, they came upon a village c onstructed of portable
round tents known as yurts. People milled about the tents, some
dressed in traditional ethnic clothing
while others wore t-shirts and jeans.
“What is this?” Dahlia asked.
“This is the World Nomad Games,”
Aidana informed her. “Think of it like the Olympics of Asia, but
instead of running and jumping, it has sports that originated in
Central Asia. The World Nomad Games started in 2014, and they
have taken place every two years since then. It’s a celebration of
the nomadic peoples from Mongolia to Turkey. People from all over
the world come to compete in the events, even Americans.”
Dahlia had never heard of the World Nomad Games. She watched
as two young men in elaborate costumes passed in front of their car
with huge birds, as big as eagles, perched on their arms. A girl her
own age in a long red gown and a very tall hat rode by on a
beautiful white horse, greeting the boys in some strange language
as she passed them.
Aidana smiled at Dahlia’s surprised
expression. “It’s interesting, I
know,” Babushka said. “And it’s not
only sports at the World Nomad
Games. It is also a cultural fe stival.
The hosting country has the
opportunity to share its culture with
visitors. In the yurt village, you can
listen to folk music and recitations of epic poems and legends,
watch traditional dances, and see traditional clothing.”
After they had parked the car, Dahlia followed her babushka into
the yurt village. All around them people were speaking languages
from many countries. Babushka explained that people were
speaking Chinese, Russian, Turkish, Korean, Mongolian, Arabic,
Armenian, French, German, S panish, and other languages, including
English.
The scent of grilled meat filled Dahlia’s nose. Aidana stopped before
a food vendor, buying them each a plateful of kuurdak, stewed
mutton with onions and spices. Dahlia eyed the food suspiciously as
they waited in line. She loved her dad’s homemade kuurdak, but she
wasn’t sure she trusted food sold from a stall.
A voice from behind Dahlia inquired, “Have you had this before?”
“It’s kuurdak.” As she answered, Dahlia turned around and promptly
froze. Standing directly behind her in all his glory was Derek Yeon, a
video camera around his neck. Dahlia’s heart skipped a beat.
“You’re Derek Yeon.”
Derek smiled. “I am. I take it you’re familiar with my work.”
Dahlia was more than simply familiar with his w ork.
She had watched every one of his videos multiple
times. “I am.” It was the understatement of the
century. “I’m Dahlia, and this is Aidana, my
babushka. That means -”
“Grandmother,” Derek finished for her. “My
Russian may be nonexistent, but I do know t hat word.” He went on to
explain he was in Kyrgsztan filming an episode of Interesting Places.
“The countryside is so beautiful here, and the culture is fascinating,”
he enthused.
“Yes, it is so beautiful, and the culture is fantastic, too!” agreed
Dahlia, avoiding her babushka’s skeptical gaze. “I could be your
translator, if you like,” Dahlia offered. “I speak both Kyrgyz and
Russian.”
“You’d really do that?” Derek asked, surprised.
“As long as it’s okay with Aidana.” Dahlia turned to Aidana, who
was watching the exchange with trepidation. “Can I?”
“No,” Aidana said. “I promised your parents I would look after you,
and I am not about to let you go wandering off with this young
man.” Dahlia felt her heart sink. “However, he can join both of us if
he wants a tour guide.”
Holding her breath, Dahlia waited for Derek’s answer. She doubted
a cool YouTube journalist would want to spend his time with her and
her babushka, but Derek immediately nodded. “It sounds like fun. Do
you mind if I film you guys?”
“No,” Dahlia answered for Aidana. “I mean, go right ahead. It’s
totally fine.” Derek powered up his camera and set about filming as
Dahlia and Aidana ate their lunch. He mostly interviewed Aidana
about local life; Dahlia slid a little closer to her grandmother.
“Let’s go check out some of the games,” Aidana suggested
as she finished her lunch and disposed of their trash.
They followed the crowd out of the yurt village to the
edge of camp, where an archery range was set up.
Instead of the round targets that Dahlia was used to
seeing in American movies, the targets were pear -
shaped, bigger on the bottom than they were on the top.
“Because there are so many different countries participating in the
World Nomad Games, there are five different types of archery,”
Aidana explained to Dahlia and Derek. “This is traditional Kyrgyz
archery. There are four women and four men on each team. They
are required to wear traditional dress when competing and are only
allowed to use wooden bows and arrows.”
With Derek beside her, it w as easy to get swept up in the games. A
woman pulled back a curved bow with the fluidity of an expert, shot
an arrow at the target, and cheered as it hit home. Excitement
bubbled in Dahlia’s chest. She couldn’t wait to watch this episode of
Interesting Places.
They spent the afternoon moving from event to event, with Dahlia
helping Derek interview various people. Then, one of the local
archers, a 20-year-old Kyrg named Umar, took them for a drive
through the countryside. Dahlia filled her camera with shots of
stunning landscapes while Derek filmed.
When they returned, Umar invited them all to a “Nomad party” that
was happening that night.
“What’s a Nomad party?” Derek asked.
“A big group of us get together and wander around all night, sort of
like nomads,” laughed Umar. “We bring food and drink and sing
songs and just keep walking. It’s a lot of fun.”
“I’m in!” replied Derek.
“Me, too!” exclaimed
Dahlia.
“No chance!” said Aidana, taking Dahlia’s hand. “We are not
nomads! We have a house and we’re going home.” She gave Derek
and Umar big hugs, wished the boys well and marched Dahlia back
to their car.
As for Dahlia, she had long forgotten about her friend’s birthday
party. She marveled at the countryside on the drive home and
looked forward to meeti ng more Kyrgyz and learning more about
their culture. Maybe she would make some videos of her own.
