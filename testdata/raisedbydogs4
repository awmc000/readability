There are several myths and legends about abandoned
babies being raised by wolves. One of the most famous is the
myth of Remus and Romulus. These twin brothers were raised
by wolves and founded ancient Rome.
There’s no way to know if that story is true. But there are true
stories about children being raised by animals.
Oxana Malaya was born in a small village in the Ukraine in
1983. Sadly, Oxana’s parents were alcoholics and did not
take good care of her. Oxana says that her mother wanted a
boy rather than a girl, so she threw Oxana out of the house to
live with the dogs. Cold, scared, and lonely, Oxana came to
depend on the dogs as her family and caregivers.
No one, not even her parents, came to
look for Oxana. She stayed in the shed
with the dogs. It was warm in the shed
with the dogs. And they brought her
scraps of food and raw meat. Oxana
soon forgot how to speak human and
began to behave like a dog.
Five years later, the neighbors finally noticed and told police.
When the authorities came, they were shocked by what
they found.
Eight-year-old Oxana walked on all fours. She couldn’t speak,
but she barked, whined, and growled like dog. She ate and
drank from dishes on the floor. She picked things up with her
mouth rather than her hands. She even shook herself off like a
dog when she got wet.
Authorities moved Oxana to an orphanage. There, she
learned how to speak and behave like a human. But even
though she was born normal and healthy, Oxana will always
be a bit different.
These days, Oxana lives in a home for people with special
needs where she takes care of cows. She loves working with
other animals, too, like horses.
Oxana has a pet dog, but definitely prefers the company of
people. She enjoys being the center of attention and making
people laugh. She says her biggest dream in life is to meet her
mother again one day.
