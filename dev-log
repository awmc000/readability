Wrote first draft of requirements/specification. Trying to get IO and
hash table working. Tested basic functionality like insertion, true/
false "contains" check, printing contents. Test frame will need 
cleanup. Resizing needs to be implemented.

Found this regex to use for syllable counting by Matt Ke on Stack 
Overflow.

/([aeiouyAEIOUY]+[^e.\s])|([aiouyAEIOUY]+\b)|(\b[^aeiouy0-9.']+e\b)/mg
