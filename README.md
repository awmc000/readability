# readability
Estimate readability of text using the Dale Chall formula.

# Usage

To compute the readability score of a text file named `story.txt`, you would run 
this command in the directory where both `readability` and `story.txt` reside.
```sh
./readability story.txt
```
If the `readability` binary and `story.txt` were in different locations, you 
might use something like this instead:
```sh
readability ~/Documents/story.txt
```
